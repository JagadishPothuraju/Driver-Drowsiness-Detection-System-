# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview

Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a computer vision--based project
that monitors a driver's facial features and eye movements in real time
to detect signs of fatigue. The system uses image processing and machine
learning techniques to identify drowsiness and trigger alerts to prevent
accidents.

## Objectives

-   Detect driver fatigue and drowsiness
-   Improve road safety
-   Provide real-time monitoring and alerts
-   Reduce accident risks

## Features

-   Real-time face and eye detection
-   Eye blink and closure analysis
-   Drowsiness alert system
-   Machine learning--based classification
